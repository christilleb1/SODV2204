        Matthew Tkachuk is an American Hockey Player playing for Calgary Flames. He was born on December 11, 1997 in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States. Before playing for the Flames, he used to play for London Knights during 2015â€“16 season. His father (Keith Tkachuk) is a retired hockey player with almost 2 decades of playing in the ice professionally for Winnipeg Jets, Phoenix Coyotes, St. Louis Blues and Atlanta Thrashers. He also has a brother (Brady Tkachuk) playing hockey professionally for the Ottawa Senators. What can I say, I guess hockey runs in the family, right?
